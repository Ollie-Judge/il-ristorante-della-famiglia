# Il Ristorante Della Famiglia

------
Il Ristorante Della Famiglia is a website for a Restaurant in London England that is designed to raise awareness to people visiting the area in which the restaurant is located, and to also raise awareness in the local area to people who do not know about the restaurants existence already. The websites goals for potential customers are: to provide the potential customer with a general rundown of information they may need before entering the restaurant, such as; events happening soon, what’s on the menu, where on a map the restaurant is located and even some history and a general background about the restaurant, such as; where the produce is sourced, what effort the restaurant is going-to to be ethical, sustainable and how they cut down on wastage. The customer should also be able to find an easy to use and access booking section which will make it easier and hassle free to reserve a table.
------
The requirements for the website by the restaurant owners are for the website to present the restaurant as a high quality, professional place that appeals to all types of people; restaurant critics, restaurant owners, families and also people that just want to have a quick meal and leave. The website should be easy to use and easily accessible for all types of people so that the website reflects the restaurant as an appealing and inclusive place. Finally, the restaurant should display all the information a customer may need, meaning when they arrive at the restaurant they’re fully informed and familiar with the restaurant and shouldn’t need to ask any questions to the waiter/waitress.

## Features

### Features found on all pages

On all of the pages you will find a fully responsive nav bar that consists of 4 navigation options; Home, Bookings, Menu and also Our Story. I have put the navigation buttons in this order because i beleive this is the order of most importance which will help the user intuitively want to move from one to the next with the least ammount of movement nessecary.

On all of the pages you will also find a banner consisting of the company logo and also the italian flag at the top and the bottom, This design is to help the user identify this as an italian restaurant without it being too obvious, such as saying what it is, it also looks professional and consistent helping the user build trust with the business, my final point for this feature is that it also is eye catching and a positive peice of content upon opening the page for the first time.

 The where to find us section is one of the most important elements of the restaurant, this is because every customer needs to know where the restaurant is loacted in order to eat there, this is why this element is on the front page.
